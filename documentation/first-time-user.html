        <h3>Attitudes and Needs:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Confident in business and creating his online brand/persona BUT NOT SO CONFIDENT IN GROWING INDOOR PLANTS! He knows he can do anything he sets his mind to but needs a little extra guidance and support around how to help keep his new plant alive. A neighbor who moved recently gave him a plant and he wants to ensure it thrives in his care. Raymell is frustrated that most websites and apps are complicated with soil testing and water ph balances. Or they have so many adds and additional links that he never quite finds what he is looking for. He wants a website or app that is simple, fun and encouraging as he goes through the adoption of this plant and settling it into his new home.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>As a new user I, Raymell, am looking for guidance and support to help me grow my newly adopted plant (it was given to me by my neighbor who just moved out) I want this plant to thrive and hope that if this goes well, I might also be able to purchase, grow and appreciate additional plants over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Interaction Flow:</h3>
        <p><u>PreCondition</u>: Raymell is searching online for assistance and guidance around caring for his new plant, and comes across our site.</p>
        <p><u>PostCondition</u>: Raymell has found a really great resource and now also has the option to receive continued additional support and guidance from the site.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raymell clicks on the link to our website
                <p>~Website opens to homepage</p>
            </li>
            <li> Raymell loves the look of the website, it feels calming and full of life, greens, golds, soft pinks... it is calm and NOT complicated! He immediately sees three options, he can either click "Welcome Back! LogIn", "New Here and Ready To Grow" or "New Here and Just Looking" Because Raymell already has a plant and he is ready to get started he selects the button, "New Here and ready to Grow."
                <p>~Website takes Raymell to a new page, with three buttons to choose from.</p>
            </li>
            <li> Raymell sees three possible answers to choose from, 1. I already have a plant(s) and or want to find a new one, 2. New to Plants and I am interested in growing a plant. Raymell clicks on the 1st option, he already has a plant but also wants to explore options for a new plant.
                <p>~Website takes Raymell to the second question, "What type of space do you have for your plant(s)? Three options are presented for Raymell To choose from; 1. A Small Size Space (window ledge, bathroom counter etc), 2. Medium Size Space (plenty of room for a new plant to grow into), 3. Large Space (Bay window, Sunroom etc)</p>
            </li>
            <li> Raymell chooses option 2, medium space as his plant will be housed in his living room, he has plenty of space but he also does not want the plant to take over! He submits his answer...
                <p>~Website stores this information in the backend and presents Raymell with the next question, "Tell us about the amount of natural light available to your plant?" There are three options to choose from; 1. Little to No Natural Light (light from only one of the the four directions or no natural light), 2. Medium amount of light (my plant receives natural light from at least 2 of the 4 directions), 3. Max Amount of Light (my plant receives natural light from at least 3 of the 4 directions and may have additional light from sunroof or bay window etc)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Raymell chooses option 2, because he has two windows in his living room, one that faces East and one that faces South.
                <p>~Website stores this information in the backend and presents Raymell with the next question, "Do you share your space with young children or pets?" 1. Yes 2.No</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Raymell chooses option 2, he is the king of his castle and extending his family with this first plant! He joyfully submits his answer.
                <p>~Website stores this information in the backend and presents Raymell with the next question, "What is you homes average temperature?" 1. On the cooler side, I like to keep my home around 60 degrees or lower, 2. I change with the seasons, I keep my average temperature between 65-75 depending on the day. 3. Some like it hot, I need my home to be above 75 degrees at all time!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Raymell selects option 1, because he lives in LA, come on! He submits his answer.
                <p>~Website stores this information and generates the next promt, Please select your current plant from the drop down menu or find a picture of it in the photo album below. Page shows Raymell a dropdown and a link to the websites photo album.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Because Raymell has already googled the name and photos of his plant he selects the plant name from the drop down menu, cordatum plant. He submits his answer.
                <p>~Website stores this information and uses it to pull information from the plant database on the plant cordatum. The website is also filtering through the plant data base to find plants that need a medium amount of light, will need room to grow, like cooler average temperatures. When the data is compiled it displays the information on the screen for Raymell to see.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Raymell sees a picture of his current plant, the cordatum with a few tips and tricks (move plant closer to windows to ensure enough warmth, due to cooler average temperature etc...) Below that Raymell sees 5 additional plants that would be comfortable in his home. Below these recommendations and current plant info is the option to create a site profile, Raymell sees that if he creates a site profile, he can track his plants growth and development using photos and journal entries. He will also recieve weekly reminders/tips and tricks form the site to support his plant relationships. Raymell is excited with the information he has recieved and is not sure about creating a profile just yet. So he screen shots the info, exits out of the site and begins rearranging his living room so his plant can be moved closer to the window.
                <p>~Website ends transaction.</p>
