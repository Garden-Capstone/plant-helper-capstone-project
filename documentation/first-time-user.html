        <h3>Attitudes and Needs:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Confident in business and creating his online brand/persona BUT NOT SO CONFIDENT IN GROWING INDOOR PLANTS! He knows he can do anything he sets his mind to but needs a little extra guidance and support around how to help keep his new plant alive. A neighbor who moved recently gave him a plant and he wants to ensure it thrives in his care. Raymell is frustrated that most websites and apps are complicated with soil testing and water ph balances. Or they have so many adds and additional links that he never quite finds what he is looking for. He wants a website or app that is simple, fun and encouraging as he goes through the adoption of this plant and settling it into his new home.</li>

        <h2>Use Case and Interaction:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As a new user of this app, Raymell really wants guidance and support to grow his newly adopted plant (given to him by his neighbor who just moved out)  to its best! He also hopes that if this goes well, he might also be able to purchase, grow and appreciate additional plants over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Interaction Flow:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Raymell sees a link to our website in a friends post, his friend has shared pictures of her two indoor plants that are thriving and look beautiful in her home, she is promoting a helpful website/app that supported her in reaching her plant goals (this website/app)
            </li>
            <li>Raymell thinks about how nice it would be to have his plant be thriving and thinks about maybe even purchasing a second plant to keep his company. So he clicks the link and it takes him to the website/app. When Raymell reaches the site he loves the look of it, it feels calming and full of life, greens, golds, soft pinks... it is calm and NOT complicated! He immediately sees a button that says "NEW HERE" and when he clicks this button is asked a question... "Just Looking" or "Ready to Grow" because is thinking about how nice this plant will look in his living room he excitedly clicks on "Ready to Grow."
            </li>
            <li>"Ready to Grow" takes Raymell through a series of questions, he fills out the questions, hits submit and is given the name and information on his plant and also given a number of recommendations of additional plants he may want to grow. From here Raymell can compare up to three plants side by side, and if he makes an additional selection, is given a list of locations nearby where hencan purchase the plant. Raymell is prompted to submit his email and to create an account. From here Raymell can become a primary user(create and account) or a casual user (come back soon). Raymell creates an account and now has weekly support to create a wonderful relationship with his new plant. Raymell is confident that he has found the support needed to provide his new plant with a happy home.
